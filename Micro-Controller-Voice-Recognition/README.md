This project is the frame work for the voice recognition used to recognize commands on an Arduino Nano BLE sense 33 with its built in microphone. The micocrontolle was developed specifically for machine learning applications and feautures suppor for TensorFlowLite.

I used personalized data gathered from the device's micrphone to best attain repeatability and responsivness. The neural network was trained using Tensorflow and converted to TensorFlow Light using the training.py script.
